# Dynamic programming
- Algorithm design technique, like divide and conquer
- Solve maximize or minimize optimization problem
- DP = “careful brute force”, reduce exponential time to polynomial time
- DP = subproblems + reuse, subproblems is the first thing to know
- DP = recursion + memorization
- DP = shortest paths in some DAG
- Memorization DP algorithms
- Bottom-up DP algorithm
    - Topological sort of subproblem dependency DAG
    - Can save space

# Algorithm list

- [Longest common subsequence](https://github.com/gaoisbest/Basic-Algorithms/blob/master/Dynamic_Programming/Longest_Common_Subsequence.py)
  - `O(m*n)`
