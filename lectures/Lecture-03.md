# Divide and Conquer
- Divide the problems into sub problems
- Conquer sub problems recursively
- Combine solutions

It is an algorithm design technique.

# Examples

## Merge sort

## Binary search
- Find x in sorted array
- Only have one sub problem

## X to the power of n

## Fibonacci numbers

- Bottom up algorithm: Compute F0, F1, â€¦Fn O(n)
- Recursive squaring
    - Matrix squaring O(lgn)

Exponential time is bad, Polynomial time is good

## Matrix multiplication
- Naive implementation: O(n^3), 8 times matrix multiplication
- Strassen algorithm: O(n^2.81), 7 times matrix multiplication
